macro:->We
should
note
that
in
a
recent
paper,
Reingold
and
Sheridan
(2014)
proposed
some
changes
on
the
original
version
of
the
procedure
by
using
confidence
intervals
rather
than
point
estimates,
but
the
both
the
conceptual
and
the
technical
limitations
outlined
in
the
present
note
apply
equally
to
the
original
and
the
modified
versions
of
the
procedure.
